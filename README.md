# Paul Tela Personal Site

This is my React powered personal site.  The goal of this project was to learn
more about React, react-router, SASS, and webpack 2.  I will be adding
additional features such as server side rendering soon.

The design of the site is based off of [Dimension by HTML5
UP](https://html5up.net/dimension) and is used under the terms of the The
